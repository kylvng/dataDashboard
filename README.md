These videos are features on their trending page and this application lists these videos, collect stats, and organize these data into stat cards so you can learn more about these top hits!**

## Notes

One of the bigger challenges I encountered while building this app would be authorizaiton of my api calls. I found difficulty navigating the documentation of the Youtube Data api and found trouble when fetching data due to a "forbidden" status code. I found out it was due to how I was authorizing my api key and fixed it quickly. Another problem would be managing many components within my app. When your component have dependencies within other components, it can get messy fast. I learned a lot through this project and plan to build upon it in the future.

## Notes

Throughout this second half, I had a hard time setting up my routes because of the way my root file rendered. Since I only had two routes, I just put them in my app.jsx. Also, the styling of the website took very long and I am still not content with it. I realized that I am not a good styler but I will continue to work on it.
